# Homepage

This wiki is just documenting the source code of Minecraft \(currently only client version 1.12\). It is mainly personal, and there might be a lot of typos, so I'll be really happy  if you'd like to participate and help me with in this enormous adventure. 

{% hint style="info" %}
As previously said, this wiki only covers the **source code** of Minecraft. For a more abstract view of the inner-working of Minecraft, I'd recommend [wiki.vg](https://wiki.vg/Main_Page), it's a really great resource, although a lot of it is outdated and not complete, so [The Official Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Minecraft_Wiki) will be also really useful. But in case nothing is already available, well you gotta be the first, I guess. Grab Wireshark \(or Burp Suite, or even any networking-analysis tool\), Eclipse \(any IDE for Java will do of course, but something with a debugger will help you, and Eclipse is really good at it\), a copy of MCP \(preferably my own version, which I try to edit according to this wiki, and which some functions that were originally obfuscated are now de-obfuscated\). And of course that wiki will be helpful.

If you do any new discovery, don't hesitate to create your own wiki, github, or contact me if you don't really have the time for any of it, I'll try to do that as soon as I can
